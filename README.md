Sehat Sathi aims to revolutionize healthcare accessibility in rural India by leveraging artificial intelligence to provide early disease detection and medical assistance. With a significant shortage of doctors, timely diagnosis remains a challenge, leading to undetected and untreated illnesses. This project focuses on integrating Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) to offer accurate disease classification and personalized health guidance through an easy-to-use web platform. By reducing dependence on medical professionals and incorporating automated solutions like medicine dispensers, Sehat Sathi strives to create a scalable, cost-effective, and efficient healthcare system for underserved populations.
